Finally, a calendar sync solution that works. After my experiment with
[gSyncIT](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.daveswebsite.com%2Fsoftware%2Fgsync%2F&ei=z-f0R6zgNoiYoQS90ZC_DQ&usg=AFQjCNH3xj_OGBn4h2o4CMxFzTU8Px_TKQ&sig2=lSOehs0id7vBbq2inRdnNQ),
I just couldn't quite get past some of its limitations. Once multiple
calendars get involved, things get a bit ugly.  
  
A coworker recommended
[SyncMyCal](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.syncmycal.com%2F&ei=Ruj0R7T5EYiYoQSX0Yy_DQ&usg=AFQjCNEmiPLtCDyy3CMY1BHS0iRFzi2pGQ&sig2=jmJ4PsN07peTa6JE9sSXVw)
as a way past those issues, and I'm pretty happy. You'll see my
calendaring setup to the right.  
  
Google Calendar is pretty much my primary calendar, and I have several
calendars loaded. Some calendars, like US, UK, Indian Holidays and the
Winterhawks game schedule are information only. However, I have my own
calendar, a family calendar for events the whole family is attending,
and two TripIt calendars (one for my wife, one for me) that do a great
job representing any travel I'm doing.  
  
I'd like to make sure that these calendars are available (at least in
free/busy form) to other Exchange users at work, and that the calendars
get posted to my cell phone using Windows Mobile. The Outlook 2007
Internet Calendars feature doesn't allow this, so I needed a solution
that would allow my Google calendars to merge into my single Outlook
calendar. I was also looking for my work calendar to post out to Google
so I could have visibility there as well.  
  
SyncMyCal had the answer through the use of category synchronization.
Each Google calendar has their events assigned to a specific category,
and only those events are sync'd with that calendar. Anything not
assigned to a category (work stuff) gets sync'd to Google under a new
"Work" calendar. I didn't need full synchronization here, but it's nice
to know I have it if I need it.  
  
What's missing? I can't find a way to have SyncMyCal make all
Google-sourced events private on the Outlook side (although it does sync
the private flag). I have to remember to mark anything truly private as
such. Not a big deal, but it's worth mentioning.  
  
There is definitely whitespace for an entrepreneur to simplify
calendaring...I can't believe that my needs are \*THAT\* special...
