I just noticed [this
post](http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/2007/03/07/internal-amd-memo-encourages-rapid-company-wide-vista-adoption.aspx),
and it's interesting to me that a company's internal OS upgrade schedule
would be taken so seriously, but this is Intel, and that, I guess, makes
things a little different.
