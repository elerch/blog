Unless you're native, don't do it. I just uploaded a few short videos of
the driving experience this past weekend in
[Delhi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sgow_rkDpw0) and in
[Agra](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C8oKtyNpVs). I've been staying in
Bangalore, but the driving experience is pretty much the same. I also
have a very short (but boring - buildings don't do a lot of stuff) video
of visiting the [Taj Mahal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6DJ6lm2x5Y).
