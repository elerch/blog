Now that I have a [fantastic
reason](http://kellyemil.blogspot.com/2006/06/kathryn-marie-sloan-lerch-born-454pm.html)
to use the new camcorder, I have been making some recordings and
otherwise playing with the features. I recently posted [two
videos](http://kellyemil.blogspot.com/2006/07/for-true-die-hard-kathryn-fans.html)
to [Youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com), and the front-to-back process
was really straight-forward...technology should continue to put
consumers at the center of their world like this:  

1.  Plug camcorder into computer, turn it on
2.  Load Windows Movie Maker
3.  Tell WMM to import video from the camcorder
4.  WMM detects the clips on the camcorder
5.  Take each clip you want to save, save the file as a seperate WMV
6.  Upload WMV file to YouTube

While the above process is really cool, here's how I could see it
optimized even further:

1.  Plug camcorder into computer, turn it on
2.  Load Windows Movie Maker
3.  Tell WMM to import video from the camcorder
4.  WMM detects clips, but also stops when hitting the end of the tape
    that's been recorded on
5.  Take each clip you want to post, post the file (menu item/context
    menu) directly to YouTube - if login required, WMM can request, or
    integrate with the upcoming
