With the recent production release of [Internet Explorer
7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx), I thought it was
time to revisit my [default browser
decision](http://emillerch.blogspot.com/2006/09/thats-bold-movewonder-how-thatll-work.html).
I've been fairly happy with [Firefox](http://www.getfirefox.com), but
have had a few annoyances:  

1.  Copy/paste of HTML tables into applications (Microsoft Word and
    Excel) doesn't work nearly as well as with IE
2.  Proxy changes don't happen without at least an extra trip to the
    options. To be fair, IE 6 didn't handle it at all, but since the
    browser lacked tabs, starting a new instance wasn't a difficulty
3.  Some internal web sites designed the authentication in a manner that
    required another click to get in
4.  When printing, some pages arrive with parts chopped off from the
    right  
5.  Some web sites (e.g. Wachovia) would break randomly for no apparent
    reason. Sometimes they would work, sometimes not  

Well, I installed IE7 and it seemed ok. I found a [mouse gesture
plugin](http://www.ysgyfarnog.co.uk/utilities/mousegestures/) to
compensate for the lack of something built in. I tried setting it as my
default browser, but after using it a bit I had it crash a couple times.
The session manager built in apparently assumes this will never happen,
because not once did it restore my session from a crash, which is
something that I've had for over a year in Firefox via the [Tab Mix
Plus](http://tmp.garyr.net/) extension.  
  
Other than the fatal flaw, I agree wholeheartedly with the [Cnet.com
review](http://reviews.cnet.com/Internet_Explorer_7/4505-3514_7-32111537.html#more)
of IE7. Firefox remains my default browser.
