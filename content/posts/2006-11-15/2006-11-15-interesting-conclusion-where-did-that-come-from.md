I was surprised to see a stock I own
([INPC](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=INPC)) on this list today:  
[Russell 3000's Best and Worst Performing Stocks: Financial News -
Yahoo!
Finance](http://biz.yahoo.com/seekingalpha/061113/20405_id.html?.v=1)  
  
It says YTD performance for INPC is 279%. I'm not sure how they get
that...the closest that I find is a 140% gain if you bought at the 52
week low (5.02) and sold at the 52 week high (12.07). I don't want to
call them a liar or anything, but if YTD is defined as Jan 1 (8.76) to
today(11.38), that is a 30% gain. If you bought when I did, you're still
down about 20% but a lot happier than when the stock was at $5/share.
