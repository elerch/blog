[Google maps](http://maps.google.com) launched a way to annotate and
save your own custom maps. I've started a map of my [overall
travels](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=115347831055055936027.00000111c2fa87f6a4242),
and one specifically focused on places I've been in India. I see this
being a big project, but it would be nice to have URLs to pictures, etc.
at each site.  
  
More tangible value for this can be seen in the map I've done to show
[where to park and how to get
to](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=115347831055055936027.00000111c286e0ab27aee)
[Bethany Community Network](http://www.bethanycommunity.net) meetings.  
  
Cool.
