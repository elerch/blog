So I made the plunge and purchased a
[NAS](http://emillerch.blogspot.com/2006/05/is-it-really-that-much-to-ask-for.html).
I got a [Buffalo Technology](http://www.buffalotech.com) product, but
not the [one that I previously
mentioned](http://www.buffalotech.com/products/product-detail.php?productid=131&categoryid=28).
The difference between the Linkstation Home Server and the Gigabit
Linkstation is DLNA certification for media streaming to a very few
certified players, which seems to add about $75 to the cost. In 5 years
I may regret it, but right now, I'm pretty happy with the
[HD-HG300LAN](http://www.buffalotech.com/products/product-detail.php?productid=106&categoryid=22).
I'm also somewhat future-proofed with the Gigabit option.  
  
I moved all the data from my external USB drive and scheduled backups
onto the USB drive (my external USB is now strictly a backup device). So
far, so good. The downside is that the data transfer had to occur over
the network since the NAS web interface doesn't allow any file
manipulation. The firmware (v1.42) is pretty rough around the edges, and
setting the security up hasn't worked so well, but everything else has
worked as advertised, and [pictures of
