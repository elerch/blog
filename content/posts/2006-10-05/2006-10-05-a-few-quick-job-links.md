Over the past few months I have thought quite a bit about resumes and
jobs outside Intel. A few quickie links for those that are looking:  
  

-   [Seven deadly sins of resume
    design](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/the-7-deadly-sins-of-resume-design.html)
    ([lifehack.org](http://www.lifehack.org), which is a pretty neat
    resource itself)  
-   [Software Association of Oregon](http://www.sao.org/)...includes
    link to
    [OregonWorks](http://www.oregonworks.org/jobs-interns.asp?page=welcome)
    for Jobs
-   [10 Ways to tweak your tech
    resume](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/10-ways-to-tweak-your-tech-resume.html),
    also on lifehack.org, but referencing eWeek. However, I disagree
    with the "lose the one page only rule" tip. When reading resumes I
    literally throw out all but the first page. If the candidate doesn't
    engage me by the bottom of page one, it wasn't meant to be. I'm not
    completely clear how to reconcile that with the keyword problem,
    though.

There's a ton of job web sites out there
([hotjobs](http://www.hotjobs.com), [monster](http://www.monster.com),
[dice](http://www.dice.com), etc.), but a quick google search will find
those pretty quickly.
