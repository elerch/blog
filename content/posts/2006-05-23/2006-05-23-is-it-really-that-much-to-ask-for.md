So I've been keeping my eyes open for a cheap but somewhat flexible
[NAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage) solution.
Quick rundown of my requirements:  

-   Stores data
-   Allows always ready backup (usually this translates to [RAID 1
    mirroring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundant_array_of_independent_disks))
-   Allows connection via
    [SMB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block), so I don't
    have to install software from a hardware manufacturer (this is my
    best known method for not getting weird errors)
-   Plugs into wired Ethernet
-   Expandable
-   Free (or at least cheap)

The other day I ran across what appears to be such a device, from a
company called
[SimpleTech](http://www.simpletech.com/commercial/simpleshare/index.php).
Now, what's amazing to me is that there is very little competition for
this. I did manage to find [something very close from Buffalo
Technology](http://www.buffalotech.com/products/product-detail.php?productid=131&categoryid=28),
and it may even be better as it does support streaming media. However,
it's backup strategy is a scheduled backup rather than RAID 1 (which
might be just fine).  
  
Other products tend to be a couple hundred dollars more expensive and
include a bunch of stuff that is nice, but not necessary to a consumer,
or in my opinion, to a small business (&lt;10 employees, probably
retail, not a lot of discretionary funds). I'm going to give it a little
time and then go get the Buffalo or SimpleTech.
