I just purchased a [Sony
HC36](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E0DU62/ref=pd_cp_p_title/104-3040708-0690318?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance&n=502394)
and documented the experience for a couple friends, so I thought I'd
share it here. Here’s the lowdown on the process (skip to step 9 if you
want to skip how I figured out what camcorder to buy).  

[Consumerreports.org](http://consumerreports.org/) led me to a JVC
camcorder, and any one of several Sony camcorders. Sony is the best
overall brand, while a couple individual JVC, Panasonic, and Cannon
camcorders rate well.

I looked at Amazon to confirm the JVC camcorder, and was surprised to
find lots of poor reviews for it. I eliminated it as a candidate.

Took a look at CNET.com for the other camcorders. They had some
reasonable advice, but being a tech-focused review site, they were
pretty much only interested in “the best of the best of the best –
sir!”. Their reviews basically pointed to buying the most expensive
camcorder (like the Sony High-Def camcorder for $3600). I was able to at
least discern some of the differences between the Sony units from CNET.

Narrowed search down to Sony basically due to a) price (this eliminated
the Panasonic) and b) a few features (like webcam abilities that
eliminated the cannon).

Googled for the differences between models and determined the
following:

Of these 6 models, I determined that there is very little difference in
the 2x/3x series. The 42/46 is significantly ($100) more expensive and
has better technical specs, but the 2x/3x differs in just a few features
and the core video capture capability is the same.

The 32 was cheapest on Amazon and I tried to do better on eBay, but was
unsuccessful.

The deal I saw on Amazon went away and a friend pointed me to
[Pricescan.com](http://pricescan.com/). The price graph on the 32 showed
a spike in prices in the current week, confirming prices were up overall
on the 32.

Based on pricescan, the prices between the 32 and 36 were pretty much
even, so I looked around various sites (Amazon,
[buy.com](http://buy.com/), [overstock.com](http://overstock.com/),
[outpost.com](http://outpost.com/),
[shopping.yahoo.com](http://shopping.yahoo.com/)) to try to beat
pricescan. **I was able to beat**
[**pricescan.com**](http://pricescan.com/)**, but only by $2.50.**

I used [shopping.yahoo.com](http://shopping.yahoo.com/) to check out
merchant reviews and make a selection. The second best price came from
the lowest price vendor on [pricescan.com](http://pricescan.com/). They
had a good review and Yahoo buyer protection and I was going to go with
them until their website had a technical difficulty. I went to the
cheapest vendor (4.5 out of 5 stars, but no Yahoo buyer protection) and
placed the order there.

I needed a set of accessories, and already knew where to get the best
deals, so I went straight to [newegg.com](http://newegg.com/). I already
had a DVD burner and media, but I ordered (total cost ~$75):

-   Firewire card for the computer
-   Firewire cable (6 pin to 4 pin)
-   25 pack DVD movie cases
-   512MB memory stick pro duo (I hate how Sony has proprietary memory
    formats).
-   6 pack of mini-DV tape

I put together a [saved wish
list](https://secure.newegg.com/NewVersion/WishList/MySavedWishDetail.asp?ID=3487544)
at newegg.com that includes what I ordered as well as the internal DVD
burner and media I would order today if I needed them. If you need the
external version of the burner it’s probably another $10-$15. Also note
that the memory is optional – as far as I know, the camera only uses the
memory stick for still photos. I’m also not 100% sure I don’t need a USB
cable to do the webcam functionality, but right now I’m assuming I can
use the firewire cable for both. You cannot use the USB cable to
transfer video with that camera, you’ll need the firewire.  
  
I passed on ordering a camcorder case. My plan there is to get all the
stuff in house and then go to target and see what would hold all of it
without taking up a ton of space. I did not see a significant savings by
ordering the case on the Internet. I also passed on tripods, lens
filters, etc. I just don’t think I’ll be going that professional, and if
I did, I’d spend a lot more on the camera (the $800 price point will get
you to a semi-pro level). I did get a phone call from the people I
bought the camcorder from trying to sell me all the accessories. I told
them “I had an older handycam and already own all the accessories”. That
got them off my back pretty quickly, but I did spend the extra $30 for a
2-year warranty. I have heard rumors that the touch screen tends to wear
out and it is not covered by Sony’s warranty.
