I read [this
piece](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/technology/20-ways-to-use-gmail-filters.html#more-3328)
on [lifehack.org](http://www.lifehack.org/) today, and saw this killer
tip:  
  
**Send spam to trash**. Instead of having Gmail-filtered spam go into
your Spam folder (and have the annoying count of unread spam by the
folder’s name), set up a filter with “is:spam” in the “has the words”
field (just click “OK” on Gmail’s warning dialog box when you click next
step) and “Delete it” as the action. Now all spam messages will go in
your trash.
