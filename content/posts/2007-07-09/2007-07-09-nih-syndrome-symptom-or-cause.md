I was listening to a podcast this morning and the person was talking
about [NIH Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Invented_Here).
This is one of those things that consistently rubs me the wrong way,
primarily because I believe that managers' actions and managers' talk
diverge significantly in this area. Many things that are not invented
here cost money. Because, as a coworker once put it, "man-hours are
free", the tendency for a lot of managers is to use their people to
re-invent the wheel rather than putting together whatever justification
the organizational bureaucracy needs to cut a PO. Since people are now
re-inventing the wheel, to satisfy their ego they must be able to do it
better. Do this enough times, and it's clear that NIH really is the
symptom of poorly performing management.  
  
Of course, person-hours are not free, rather they've already been
negotiated for, while budgeting extra dollars for outside products or
services often involves more administrative work. It's the management
path of least resistance.
