So [smaller files are better off on flash
memory](http://emillerch.blogspot.com/2006/08/back-in-flash.html)? Small
files:  
  

-   Source code
-   Most web stuff (HTML, CSS, JS, etc., etc.)
-   Lots of miscellaneous docs (word, powerpoint, exel)  

Sounds to me like the best way to work on these things is to use flash
memory as your primary work area and copy the files to hard disk only as
backup. At least until [Hybrid hard
drives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_drive) solve the problem...
