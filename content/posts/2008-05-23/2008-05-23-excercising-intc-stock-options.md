So I've excercised the remaining stock options from Intel that remain
above water. There are still a large number of options that will die
worthless (my original options were priced at $67 back in 2001, current
stock price is $23.52, and there were no splits in between). The next
set of options that even have a shot at becoming in the money are priced
around $26, and with 3 weeks out, it would be surprising if they became
valuable. Here's the quick story of how the excercise went down.  
  
I excercised in three batches. The first batch I got totally lucky and
sold at $27.98, exactly $0.01 off the 52 week high. Dumb luck. I sold
only half because word on the street was that Q1 would be great, and the
price would keep going up. In retrospect, I think selling half was a
good move, but my big mistake here was not to have sold the most
expensively priced options. Those options at $26 would have actually
been worth something.  
  
The stock tanked this year, but recently began to gain ground. Oddly, it
picked up momentum based on almost no news (the overall market was also
up). Intel did [get an
upgrade](http://www.thestreet.com/s/tech-winners-and-losers-intel/newsanalysis/winnerstech/_msnh/10417027.html?&cm_ven=MSNH&cm_cat=FREE&cm_ite=NA)
that did pretty well for the stock. Due to what seemed to be a short
term movement and the imminent expiration of my options, I dug out some
of my technical analysis knowledge and went to town:  
  
I watched the following indicators:  
  

-   [MACD](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp): I was looking
    pretty short-term (&lt;1&gt;
-   [Bollinger
    Bands](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bollingerbands.asp): I
    thought this would be a fairly useless indicator, but in fact, it
    was just when the stock crossed the upper band that it turned
    negative.
-   [RSI](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp): Fairly useful
    indicator in this scenario
-   [Slow Stochastic
    Oscillator](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stochasticoscillator.asp):
    Fast stoch always seems too touchy for me. Maybe if I were trading
    several times a day it would be different, but the slow stoch was
    useful
-   [Parabolic
    SAR](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parabolicindicator.asp): My
    primary source of when the options should be sold.  

When the stock hit 25 and retreated a bit to 24.60, I decided to sell my
second batch, a fairly small set of options that were priced in the mid
23's. My primary thinking here was to lock in some of the options since
going up over 5% in one day on no news was just crazy.  
  
At 25, the MACD, Bollinger Bands and RSI indicators all went bearish, so
I thought I'd sell when the price started to dip. The next day it opened
pretty low and then dropped below 24.13, which was the Parabolic SAR
trigger point, so now all the indicators I was tracking went bearish. I
sold at 24.08, and so far, it's down another 0.85 from there.  
  
Lessons learned? The indicators can work...don't rely on just one, and
make sure that you use the right indicator for your goal.  
  
Another couple links of use:  

-   [Scottrade
    chart](http://research.scottrade.com/public/stocks/charts/charts.asp?symbol=INTC):
    This chart is continuously updated, and summarizes what the
    indicators are saying (e.g. Parabolic Indicator is bearish/MACD is
    bullish). The conintuous updates made it more useful than Yahoo. It
    does, however, force you to re-add the indicators - no deep link is
    possible.
-   [Yahoo
    chart](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=INTC#chart1:symbol=intc;range=1m;indicator=bollinger+psar+rsi+macd+stochasticfast;charttype=candlestick;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined):
    I was originally using this chart from Yahoo. Since the URL includes
    all the options, it looks exactly as I was using. However, it only
    updates at the end of each day.

    let me watch the stock in real-time during the day.
