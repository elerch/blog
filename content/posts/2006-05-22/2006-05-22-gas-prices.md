One of my soapbox items for the press is their failure to report
historical prices/costs on a [real
basis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_vs._nominal_in_economics). This
is a disservice and misleads people. Over the last year there's been a
lot of discussion about oil prices. Today I searched/found a [good/short
article on gasoline and oil
prices](http://api-ec.api.org/filelibrary/PumpPriceUpdate.pdf) from the
[American Petrolium Institute](http://www.api.org) that reports on a
real basis. The bad news? On a real basis, we are indeed near (but not
quite at) historical record highs for gas at the pump...
