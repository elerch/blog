I just changed offices and so I've taken the opportunity to try out a
new monitor setup. My primary machine is a laptop and I have a external
monitor, so I've always enjoyed the extra real estate of an extended
desktop, at least when I'm in the office. However, I was finding the
setup of limited use the way I had it, with my monitor above the laptop.
After moving to the new office, I put the monitor to the (left) side of
the notebook, and now on day 2 I'm finding it to be very comfortable and
useful. Biggest downside so far is that it's on the left side, so I
almost expect it to be the primary monitor (I assume this is my cultural
expectation since I read left to right). I'd rather have it on the left
for other reasons, and I don't want it to be considered the primary to
make it easier to dock/undock the laptop without running.  
  
Just a quick Friday rambling...
