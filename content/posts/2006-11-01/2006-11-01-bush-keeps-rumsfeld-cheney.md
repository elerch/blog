Here's something interesting I heard yesterday. Bush came out and
announced he will [hold onto Rusmfeld and Cheney until the end of his
administration](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=2621650).
Despite what you may think of the administration, it says a lot that
Bush has to come out and make that kind of statement.
