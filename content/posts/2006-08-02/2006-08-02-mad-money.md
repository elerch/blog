I've found [Mad Money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Money) to be an
interesting and entertaining show. I am watching more regularly now that
my daughter has arrived and I need something to do while she sleeps in
my arms, and with the summer here, this is not bad. Anyway, I don't
always agree with [Cramer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cramer)
(the host), but where I have agreed and taken action on his
recommendations, it's worked out well. The latest trade is [Valero
Energy (VLO)](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=t&s=VLO), bought before Q2
earnings announcement yesterday. Earnings came out as (Cramer) expected.
Yesterday wasn't a good day for the market, but today both the market
and Vallero seems to be heading in the right direction...  
  
I recommend the show, but only if combined with your own research and
analysis. Make sure you're not "drinking the Kool-aid".
