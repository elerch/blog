I don't think so. The [theory/hypothesis is full of
crap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_market_theory). We learned
this in our finance classes in our MBA, but I don't buy it. There are
several versions of it, but even the most weak of the arguments claims
that technical analysis won't work. From what I've studied of technical
analysis, it's trying to use numbers and history to predict aggregate
investor psychology. A simple form would be that if a stock is at it's
52 week high, more investors think it's time to take profits than
investors think it's time to get into the stock, so the price will
probably go down.  
  
Efficient theory claims the market is a machine that absorbs information
and adjusts the prices within seconds to account for that information.
Nothing else matters. I think the market is made up of people, and
people have feelings, and stocks become either overhyped or forgotten.
And when that stock hits it's 52 week high, I know I start to consider
taking my money off the table...  
  
I like [Warren Buffett's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett)
feeling on the matter (which comes from [Benjamin
Graham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Graham)). Take a look at
[this
commentary](http://www.fool.com/news/commentary/2006/commentary06072201.htm)
also.
