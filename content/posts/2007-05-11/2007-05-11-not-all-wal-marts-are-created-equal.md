I recently used Wal-Mart's [Site to
Store](http://www.walmart.com/sitetostore) (not a bad service!) to buy
an [entertainment
center](http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=5614670)
for our house. The [particular
store](http://www.walmart.com/storeLocator/ca_storefinder_details_short.do?rx_title=com.wm.www.apps.storelocator.page.serviceLink.title.default&edit_object_id=2552&rx_dest=%2Findex.gsp&sfsearch_state=&sfsearch_city=&sfsearch_zip=97229)
I had it delivered to, however, was ickier than most Wal-Marts. Allow me
to illustrate this store's placement on a standard statistical
bell-curve of Icky-ness:
