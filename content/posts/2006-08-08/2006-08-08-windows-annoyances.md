Why is it that after roughly [18 years of work on the Windows NT family
of operating systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_nt), Windows
XP still forgets my desktop background picture?  
  
As I had deleted the original file, I had to go spelunking today to
figure out that it's copied to C:\\Documents and
Settings\\\[username\]\\Local Settings\\Application
Data\\Microsoft\\Wallpaper 1.bmp. The most frustrating part is that I
could see the picture, but only when logging out/shutting down.
