I just posted a [small
utility](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/validate-sqlserver-proc.aspx)
on [CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com) to check for valid stored
procedures, views, and functions (in SQL Server). It's actually a polish
of some work someone else had done earlier, but if you have a large
number of objects and are doing significant database refactoring, you
may want to check it out.
