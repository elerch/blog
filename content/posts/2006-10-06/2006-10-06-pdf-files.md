Couple cool pieces of free sofware to do PDF stuff:  
  

-   [Foxit reader](http://www.foxitsoftware.com). If you're tired of
    Adobe Reader's slow load times, splash screens, intrusive update
    process and desire to install a bunch of other crap on your system,
    this is for you. My favorite feature (besides 1.5MB install and
    super-fast load time) is the ability to annotate PDF documents
    (highlight sections, strikeout, type onto forms that weren't
    designed for forms, etc.). There are some nits with the software,
    but nothing worth going back to Adobe Reader for. Fantastic.
-   [PrimoPDF](http://www.primopdf.com/). Installs a virtual printer
    that creates a PDF file. File-&gt;Print from any application and get
    a PDF output. There's a few other pieces of software that do the
    same thing as well.

Foxit software also has a fairly cheap PDF editor even though you could
technically edit using the reader and the PrimoPDF tool. This makes me
wonder...is the one of the main benefit for PDFs (non-editable content
without resorting to serious DRM technologies) starting to erode?
