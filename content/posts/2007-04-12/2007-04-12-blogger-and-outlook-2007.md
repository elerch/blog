I noticed that atom feeds from blogger in Outlook 2007 appear to be
broken. All posts (at least on my machine) show up with a date of
12/31/2006. This [help
file](http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=42662&query=rss&topic=&type=f)
shows you how to get to an RSS feed, which works correctly in Outlook.
Note that the trick does <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span>
work with the old style blog URL (http://example.blogspot.com/atom.xml),
but only with the new style URL available only with the new blogger
(http://example.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/full?alt=rss).  
  
[This
post](http://binnyva.blogspot.com/2006/09/blogger-changed-feed-url-for-blogger.html)
helped me figure out the new URL. Unfortunately, all I've seen in
blogger help is [how to embed the URL in your
template](http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=42663) rather
than a help file telling you what the URL actually is. For reference,
here are the URLs for this blog, which I'll add to the template
shortly:  
  
Atom 1.0: <http://emilsblog.lerch.org/feeds/posts/full>  
RSS 2.0: <http://emilsblog.lerch.org/feeds/posts/full?alt=rss>
