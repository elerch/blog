Seagate = Hard Drives  
Hard Drives...needed for 1st Gen PVRs (e.g. Tivo, Windows Media Center)
and future (High Def) generations  
Hard Drives...needed for personal music players that have lots of
storage (or who add video)  
Hard Drives...needed for advanced gaming machines  
Hard Drives...needed for all the music and/or videos you're
downloading  
Hard Drives...needed for all those 5MP digital pictures you're taking  
  
Advanced gaming machines, personal music players, digital photography,
peer-to-peer downloading, PVRs...all are examples of technologies that
are expanding rapidly and are at various (leading) points of the
[technology adoption
curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations). These
technologies are using more and more data, and the technology is quickly
becoming mainstream.  
  
The [data storage industry](http://biz.yahoo.com/ic/813.html) is
dominated by EMC, but EMC is mostly a business storage deal. Other major
consumer data storage businesses are Western Digital and Maxtor. Seagate
is buying Maxtor, and is cheaper (in terms of P/E) than Western Digital
(in my opinion, for no good reason).  
  
Bottom line is that this company is doing the right things, positioned
well in an expanding industry, and should enjoy higher than average
shareholder returns for the next several years. Major threats? Western
digital drives prices down and kills the industry, but they can still
lower margins and increase turns in an industry that's expanding so
rapidly. My biggest concern would be
optical/[holographic](http://www.inphase-technologies.com/technology/index.html)
technology that provides much higher capacities in the same size form
factor, but I believe we're still several years out from that, giving
Seagate an opportunity to develop the technology themselves or purchase
an emerging player in that market.
