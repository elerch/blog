I just noticed that [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com) introduced the
ability to show historical "average traffic" for any given time on
particular day of the week. I just used it to confirm my commuting
schedule, and it seems to correlate well with my experiences and
validate that the times I drive are pretty reasonable.  
  
There are definitely some systemic traffic slowdowns in the Portland
area. For example, 26 west bound between [Murray and
Bethany](http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&layer=t&ll=45.5243,-122.816548&spn=0.021047,0.057335&z=15)
is nearly always a problem from 4PM-7PM, probably stemming from the fact
that the road moves from 3 lanes down to 2 just after the Bethany exit.
This is especially unfortunate since the third lane was just
added...although I do admit that there are much more serious traffic
concerns in the area to focus our resources on.  
  
It would be nice to know that those that plan road improvements take a
look at this type of data to prioritize their efforts.
