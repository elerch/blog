I recently installed both [password
safe](http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/) and
[foldershare](https://www.foldershare.com/), with the intention of using
them together to:  

-   Maintain my passwords in a more secure way (password safe)
-   Have a copy of the passwords synced on the computers I use
    (foldershare)

The solution works great, and is highly recommended. Foldershare is
blocked at work, but my password file doesn't get changed too
frequently, so I'm ok with it. Prior to finding foldershare, I actually
started coding my own solution - this was a great find, and I can't wait
to see what Microsoft does with it post-acquisition.
