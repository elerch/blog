Here is the head of the fish I caught in Mexico. It's a
[Roosterfish](http://www.anglingdirectholidays.com/pages/rooster_fish.html).
We had a great time hanging out and pretty much lounging, but on Tuesday
we went fishing and I taught the locals a thing or two. This fish is 63"
long and 96lbs. The world record Roosterfish is 66" long and 114lbs. The
fish my brother-in-law caught was no slacker either. We hooked into
these fish within a few seconds of each other, and his fish was 54" long
and 83lbs. In the picture below, we're a little hunched over because
that is really heavy, and slippery.
