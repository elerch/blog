I had a little pen issue - a few of my good pens were wearing out. Bad
pens kind of bother me. I'm too cheap to spend a lot of money on pens. I
did a quick search on the Internet, came across [this
review](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=2&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.moleskinerie.com%2F2006%2F06%2Fpen_review_unib.html&ei=Y3TNR_mlLIqmpASn4Jz6Dw&usg=AFQjCNGpdn4gtLXgHNFFafCf2HdYWA88vA&sig2=WYOUzwwaUAwsN5nS-GyTsQ),
and was sold. Costco carries a [pack of 12 for
$15.68](http://www.costco.com/Browse/Productgroup.aspx?Prodid=11275103&search=207&Mo=2&cm_re=1_en-_-Top_Left_Nav-_-Top_search&lang=en-US&Nr=P_CatalogName:BC&Sp=S&N=5000043&whse=BC&Dx=mode+matchallpartial&Ntk=Text_Search&Dr=P_CatalogName:BC&Ne=4000000&D=207&Ntt=207&No=0&Ntx=mode+matchallpartial&Nty=1&topnav=&s=1)
online (I thought they were 11.59 in the store, though). Done deal -
after about a month, I'm still <span
