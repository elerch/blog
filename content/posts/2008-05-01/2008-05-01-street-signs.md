When crossing the street and seeing one of the standard walk signs (such
as the one to the left), I have a habit of imitating the sign and saying
"white man walking".  
  
Well, Sweden is now crossing the gender barrier with their [new
signs](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90090667).
Where this will lead, I'm not sure. Non-caucasians? Dogs? Cats? It does
make me wonder, if the signs are specific, is Sweden now implying that
where this sign is posted, only women are allowed to walk?
