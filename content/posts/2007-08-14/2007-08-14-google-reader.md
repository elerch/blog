So I'm now giving [Google Reader](http://reader.google.com) a try, for
the following reasons:  

1.  I am going on an extended, paid leave from Intel shortly, and will
    likely not be using my notebook much
2.  As a result of \#1, I want to be able to read my feeds anywhere  
3.  I believe Outlook RSS is contributing heavily to random slowdowns
4.  Outlook RSS is certainly helping Outlook slam my hard disk (this is
    a problem in Outlook 2003, seems to have gotten worse in 2007, and
    is even crazier with several RSS feeds)
5.  I don't see duplicate posts in Google reader the way I was in
    Outlook. In Outlook it once got so bad that my RSS feeds were
    consuming more than 250MB of storage in my account, mostly due to
    one 2MB post that it refused to detect as a duplicate.

I tried Google Reader a while ago and wasn't a big fan of the interface,
but now that I'm using it a bit more I like it. A big problem for me is
that it defaults to expanded view, which I still don't like. List view
is much better, as I rarely read the items (the trend tools tell me that
over the last few days I've read 10% of posts in even my favorite
feeds).  
  
Another problem is offline usage, which was somewhat fixed by [Google
Gears](http://gears.google.com). I don't like the fact that I have to
manually click the icon to download data (apparently this is [supported
in gears, but not implemented by the reader
developers](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Berlind/?p=529)...fix this!). I
suppose I'll have to deal with this, but it's one more thing to remember
if I'm taking a flight.  
  
On the flip side, I love the fact that I can click on a folder and see
all the posts for all the feeds underneath it. I couldn't do this in
Outlook (and only sort of could in some other products I tried), and
resorted to using [Yahoo! Pipes](http://pipes.yahoo.com) to combine a
bunch of feeds that weren't updated frequently. The problem is that I
couldn't clearly see the source of the post anymore, since pipes renames
the source to the name of your pipe, and I couldn't figure out how to
undo this.  
  
The folder aggregation feature allows me the ability to undo the work in
Pipes, and now I can see the sources. Rarely do I click on an actual
feed...mostly I walk through folder by folder and mark all as read
unless something catches my eye. Oh - and the keyboard shortcuts are
nice too. Eventually I'm sure I'll want search capabilities, but
hopefully that will be done before I actually need it. In the meantime,
Google can work on the offline issues. ;-)
