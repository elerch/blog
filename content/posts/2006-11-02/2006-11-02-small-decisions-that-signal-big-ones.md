The other day I was visited by someone with a stack of manuals for a
technology/product that we're using in our group. I was asked whether we
should throw those manuals out of keep them. I told them to go ahead and
throw it out.  
  
This is a technology/product that is currently in use. We're moving to a
new technology/product, and that small decision to throw out the manuals
felt to me more like a massive strategic decision that yes, we're
committed to the new direction.
