So, with energies poured into other things, it's been a very, very long
time. My intention from here out is to be a little more regular (I'm
shooting for at least once/yr). ;-)  
  
I'll come back over the next couple days to talk about the baby, ASP.Net
2.0, the new car, phone/mp3 player, etc., etc. Hopefully with the baby
site I won't be posting to a crowd of no one!  
  
With the baby I have finished up doing an application for our
[contest](http://www.lerch.org/baby). Couple factoids about the
site/technology/industry:  
  

-   .NET hosting providers are consistently more expensive, especially
    if you want a database. I'm sure this is due to an MS tax, but also
    makes me wonder about TCO for .NET.
-   ASP.Net 2.0, which really does do a good job of killing off most of
    the hand-coding that used to be needed. Typical Microsoft evolution
    means that figuring out/controlling what it's doing is more
    difficult if you don't want the packaged behavior.
-   My
    [phone](http://reviews.cnet.com/Audiovox_SMT5600/4505-6452_7-31138516.html)
    has a web browser, which I will need when the baby is born and I
    need to call people. One of the most difficult/time consuming parts
    of the site was getting the infrastructure to understand that my
    phone can accept cookies. Not absolutely necessary, but I did not
    want to have to log in (which is necessary for the admin interface)
    during all the excitement.
