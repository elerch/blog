Even one presentation like this
[video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn7KaS0UtA8) is too much. Tell me
how you plan to achieve actual business results, and give me some
realistic numbers. The [hockey
stick](http://www.burbed.com/wp-content/uploads/StickGraph2.png) doesn't
cut it without significant justification. What really bothers me is when
I'm told (especially by my own management), "the numbers are just too
hard to get, but there is absolutely a positive ROI to this". Nine times
out of 10 it's a cop out, and the translation is that you're just too
lazy to do the analysis you should be doing.
