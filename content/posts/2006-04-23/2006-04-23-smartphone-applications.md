Hmm...so Smartphone 2003 (a.k.a. Windows Mobile 2003 a.k.a. Windows CE
4.21) doesn't come with a version of notepad for short notes.  
  
Problem now [solved](http://sourceforge.net/projects/notepadsf). I wrote
a quick notepad application. Curiously, Smartphone 2003 doesn't have a
standard control for navigating the file system. The guys at
[OpenNetCF](http://www.opennetcf.org/CategoryView.aspx?category=Home)
have some great extensions, and although I can't find it right now,
there is are File Dialogs to help you open and save documents.  
  
I also decided to write a [stopwatch
application](http://sourceforge.net/projects/stopwatchplussf). The
application has standard start/stop/reset/lap functions, but also adds
logging to a file (no, you can't change it). It also has a unique
feature that helps explain why I built it: It will time contractions
(and display the last hour's average frequency and duration), show you
the last 5 frequency and durations of the contractions, and tell you
when it's time to go to the hospital. I expect it to be quite handy
around the [end of June...](http://kellyemil.blogspot.com/)
