Just got back from Taiwan a few hours ago, and I'm refining my theory
about flying business class. Here are the two rules that I have now:  
  

-   If flying for business and the flight is &gt;6 hours, your company
    should pick up business class (Intel does not, and I think the
    policy is ridiculous - the difference in how rested you are at the
    end of a long flight between business and economy is crazy)
-   If you're going to upgrade yourself due to poor company policy, try
    to get upgraded on the way back, rather than on the way out. This
    may be a work/life priority thing, but for me I'd much rather push
    through some business meetings than be exhausted when I get home and
    want to do things with friends and family.  

Unfortunately, I did not get upgraded (was waitlisted but didn't clear
the list) on the way back home, so I'm currently exhausted. Off to bed
for a couple hours...
