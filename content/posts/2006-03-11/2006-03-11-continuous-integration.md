I'm a big fan of the concept of [continuous
integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration), which
is the concept that code is built and tested as early and as often as
possible. As soon as a change is completed/checked in, the code is built
and tested. Usually this is done automatically (as an aside, I wonder
how this approach can work well with enterprise software). Anyway, I saw
[this
article](http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Continuous-Integration-on-a-Dollar-a-Day.html)
and I found it pretty amusing. Now I have a good reason to get a rubber
chicken...
