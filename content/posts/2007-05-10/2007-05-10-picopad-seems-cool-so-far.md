I just got my
[Picopad](http://www.everydayinnovations.com/pages/products_picopad.php)
in the mail and slipped it into my wallet. Everything seems as
advertised so far, but I have yet to try it out in a live environment.  
  
I've loved my

knife for a long time, but I've had a problem with using it while
traveling. I don't like to take it off my keyring and check the knife,
so I'm stuck leaving it at home, and it's when I travel that I seem to
need it most. 90% of the time I pull the knife out is to use the pen
that it has. The picopad solves this problem, and gives me something to
write on as well. When not traveling, I'll almost definitely keep my
knife with me, but now it's not so critical.
