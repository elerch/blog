I usually try to refrain from posting work-related stuff since you
quickly start riding a fine line for what content is acceptable, but
today I'll go ahead. We are (still) in the middle of our
"[restructuring](http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20060905corp.htm)"
(a.k.a. 10% downsizing). Quick update from my seat of visibility:  

-   April - first "efficiency" announcement internally and to wall
    street. Announced to complete in 90 days (August).  
-   June/July timeframe: Number of "redeployments" affected several
    groups. A few friends of mine were affected by this. Since this was
    the first action, everyone I know was able to find another job
    inside Intel.
-   July: 1000 Manager reduction. My manager and my 3rd level manager
    were both laid off.
-   August: Announcement that analysis was complete on time, but
    execution on that analysis would take until the end of the year.
    Redeployments would occur in September.
-   September: Redeployments will occur WW39 for managers and WW40 for
    other employees. In normal terms, WW39 is the week beginning
    September 25th and WW40 is the week beginning October 2nd.
-   Last week: My admin was "redeployed" and I'm told that our group
    will have a 20% reduction. Another group I work closely with will
    have a 75% reduction.

I'll keep a lot of my analysis of this to myself for the time being, but
will mention that a redeployment at Intel means that you are given
several months where your job at Intel is literally to find another job
at Intel using our internal system. Alternatively, you can opt to leave
immediately and take a severance payment. There are some internal
positions open, but not many, so a redeployment effectively means a lay
off right now.  
  
For those reading that think that the process is very long, I agree, but
will offer that it appears as though management is trying to work the
logistics of the process in such a way as to make sure that people that
are affected are eligible for a few bonuses. If true, that's a nice
silver lining to this particular cloud.
