I've created a video on the basic use of REST from a consuming
developer's perspective.  It covers the following:

  

Normal HTTP Methods:

  

-   POST
-   GET
-   PUT
-   DELETE
-   PATCH

  

I cover the use of PATCH to replace special-purpose functions in MVC,
singular vs plural urls and search apis.  I also demonstrate the use of
the methods at a browser console (w/jQuery). Length - 19:23.
