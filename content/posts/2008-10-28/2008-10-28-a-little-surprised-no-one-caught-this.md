So I just watched last week's [SNL Weekend Update
Thursdays](http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/video/categories/weekend-update-thursdays/29439/)
on [NBC.com](http://nbc.com), and decided to play around with their
viewer. I haven't watched shows there before, but the Olympics were
Silverlight and I wanted to know if they used
[Silverlight](http://silverlight.net/) (no, they use
[Flash](http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash)),
and what features they had. I hit the info button (the thing with the
arrow pointing to it), and was greeted with the interface you see
below...the red box is mine (added for emphasis). Clearly they had some
of the original mockup "[Lorem
Ipsum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum)" in there and no one
bothered to update it or correct it.
