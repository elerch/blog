[![](/posts/2007-05-21/thumbnails/2007-05-21-quick-tip-on-google-calculator-google+toolbar.png)](/posts/2007-05-21/2007-05-21-quick-tip-on-google-calculator-google+toolbar.png)I
noticed a while ago that [google toolbar](http://toolbar.google.com/) in
both [firefox](http://www.firefox.com/) and
[IE](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.asp) has a very nice
feature. As you type a search, it will do an autocomplete based on
popular searches. However, if you put in [google calculator
terms](http://www.google.com/help/calculator.html), it will also provide
the calculator answer in the dropdown, so you don't even have to hit
enter to see the answer. I used this yesterday, for instance, to
determine how many teaspoons it takes to make 1/2 a tablespoon (1/2
tblsp in tsp).
