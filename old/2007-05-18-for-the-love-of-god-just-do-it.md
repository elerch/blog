Sometimes it's the little things that just drive you nuts. Like all the
meeting requests I get from people with location "TBD". At Intel it
takes about 1 minute to schedule a conference room or phone meeting.
You're already spending at least 2 or 3 minutes finding the right
attendees and putting together an agenda for the meeting, why postpone
this minor inconvenience? Inevitably this "TBD" gets sent in another
update about 15 minutes before the meeting. Spend a little bit of extra
time and save yourself the hassle of:  
  

-   People who printed out or downloaded meeting information and don't
    have network connectivity just before the meeting
-   Forgetting about to fill in the TBD completely and having to start
    the meeting 5 minutes late as you scramble to schedule something (1
    minute because you're late to begin with, 4 minutes trying to go
    through a 1 minute procedure while people are IMing you to tell you
    that you forgot to add phone conference information)  
-   Not getting the information to people who have been forwarded the
    request
