I found a cool post from Scott Hanselmann the other day [regarding
encrypted flash drives and password
lists](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/2006ResolutionPrepare.aspx). I'm
definitely using [truecrypt](http://www.truecrypt.org), and I'm taking a
look at [password minder](http://www.pluralsight.com/tools.aspx).
