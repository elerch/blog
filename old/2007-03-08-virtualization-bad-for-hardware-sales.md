I just read [this
blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2007/01/22/is-virtualization-bad-for-hardware-sales.aspx),
which points to [this article](http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=4324), and
I disagree. Virtualization is good for hardware sales, because it
shortens the hardware refresh cycle. It will certainly cause a shift
toward a fewer number of larger, more expensive servers, but it also
means that replacing those servers with faster ones will be a lot
simpler, and companies will be much more likely to throw more hardware
at performance problems than they were in the past.
