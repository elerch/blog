We had a fantastically well done April Fools joke played on the 100k or
so Intel employees today.  
  
Everyone in the company received an email stating that there was a major
new deal between Apple and Intel, and that executives would host a
webcast to announce it today at 8:30AM Pacific. The webcast has been
replaying every half hour since then. Very little details have been
posted about the content of the announcement, and the article on our
internal web site states that the announcement will be made public to
the stock market tomorrow (Friday March 31st).  
  
I missed the original webcast (conflicting meeting), but caught it later
in the day. Keep in mind this is an April Fools joke...but the
executives announced a merger between Intel and Apple. They demonstrated
the new name (mactel), the new logo, new tag line (leap different), and
talked about transition plans, and why they decided to merge. By the
time they got to uniforms (black turtleneck) and Intel, wait, sorry -
mactel values of "Be Cool", it was pretty obvious it was a joke.  
  
Intel does a great job with April fools every year. Normally they turn
our internal website into a huge pile of fake news, interviews, etc.
This year, April 1st lands on a Saturday, so they thought they'd get us
all a little early. Since it wasn't the standard fake news that we've
now become accustomed to, it was extremely effective. We may be a big
company, but we do have fun every once in a while.  
  
I still hope they do the fake news...it may even be worth logging into
work on Saturday just to read it. ;-)
