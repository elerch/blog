I'm finally getting bookmarks under control, and I can't believe how
much better life is. When you use Internet Explorer for stuff that
doesn't like Firefox (and for most things work-related), and Firefox for
normal browsing, and you have multiple computers, things get pretty
unweildy. Now, thanks to [Google](http://www.google.com/bookmarks), my
problem is mostly solved.  
  
There are several bookmark managers out there, but only Google Bookmarks
seems to have solved my main problem and has support for both Internet
Explorer and Firefox. Here are the caveats:  

1.  Internet explorer support is through a [beta version of the Google
    toolbar](http://www.google.com/tools/toolbar/T4/index.html)
2.  The Google toolbar for Firefox is still back a few revisions, so I
    need a [third party firefox
    extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2453/) to support it.
3.  [Maxthon](http://www.maxthon.com/), the software I use to get
    Internet Explorer in tabs until [IE
    7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx) comes out,
    doesn't support the google toolbar, and there's no good addon for
    Maxthon directly. I'm starting to use IE (without Maxthon) a fair
    amount now, and it's the one big downside to this bookmark thing.
