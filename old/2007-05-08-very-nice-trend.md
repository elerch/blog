I like the idea of being able to quickly have a full OS and environment
available for use through the distribution of files for a virtual
machine. Especially with the cost of VM software driving down quickly
(for personal use without support this is now usually free), this is
especially useful for development and testing.  
  
A couple quick links on this:  

-   [rBuilder Online - Release: LAMP
    appliance](http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/lamp/release?id=5228)
    (I found the latest release to be broken, but this one works - your
    results may vary)  
-   [Orcas Community Technology
    Preview](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=82243606-d16d-445c-8949-9ee8c10cda2e&displaylang=en).
    Next generation Visual Studio on a virtual machine - no need to risk
    pre-production software on a machine you care about.  
-   [Windows XP with IE6 or
    IE7](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=21EABB90-958F-4B64-B5F1-73D0A413C8EF&displaylang=en).
    Great tool for testing  
-   [Directory of user-contributed VMWare images for a variety of
    purposes](http://www.vmware.com/vmtn/appliances/directory/community.html)  

Also there are some conversion tools for those that prefer VPC over
VMWare or vice-versa:  
  

-   [VPC to VMWare conversion](http://www.vmware.com/converter)  
-   [VMWare to VPC
    conversion](http://vmtoolkit.com/files/folders/converters/entry8.aspx)  

I'm sure other converters are available for Xen, etc. As other food for
thought, many virtual hard disks could fit on a USB key, making these
OS's fairly portable.
