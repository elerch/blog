As mentioned in a [previous
post](http://emillerch.blogspot.com/2006/03/gmail-vs-windows-live-mail-vs-yahoo.html),
I had some significant issues getting Yahoo! Mail up and running. The
issue is now resolved. For the record, I believe that the issue stemmed
from the fact that I established my Yahoo! ID back in 1995 (or
thereabouts) and did not sign up for mail service on the ID at the time.
I did not really want to establish a new ID for the test. Anyway, here's
the scoop:  
  

-   February 25th: Original ticket submitted
-   February 27th: Stock answer that the problem is temporary, and maybe
    I should click refresh on my browser. Not sure why it took two days
    for what an autoresponder could have done, but whatever. Responded
    that I tried IE and Firefox, logged out, logged in, etc., etc.  
-   February 28th: Received response that they are looking into the
    issue.
-   March 5th: Responded to Yahoo! asking for an update. Received
    response that they're still working on it.  
-   March 22nd: Responded to Yahoo! asking for an update.  
-   March 29th: After a full week, I received a message saying "the
    issue may have been transient and appears to be resolved now". My
    conclusion at this point - Yahoo! did not actually look into the
    issue over the entire month. I'm basically back at "please hit
    refresh".
-   April 1st: Hadn't checked into my email, so I read the March 29th
    message and responded with "This is not yet resolved."
-   April 2nd: Finally I seem to get someone's attention. They ask me
    for a bunch of account details (not sure why they need this, but
    they're finally looking at my account setup rather than assuming I'm
    reporting a general server outage).
-   April 3rd: Respond with account details
-   April 3rd: Yahoo! <span style="font-weight: bold;">replies to my
    response</span> asking for account details. After a month of back
    and forth blaming me for not hitting refresh, now they prove they
    can't even read.
-   April 4th: I send my reply "I already did. Please see original
    message below"
-   April 6th: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Michelle</span> replies
    to me stating a definitive, "We have completed our investigation of
    the issue you reported, and were able to identify the cause and take
    corrective mesaures to address it...". This sounds positive!
-   April 7th: I verify that I now have a Yahoo! mail account and can
    log in. I send a "It's resolved - thank you!".

The entire time I had hoped to actually call them so I could convince
someone on the phone that this is an account issue, not a server issue,
but alas, no support phone numbers were to be found. I actually
considered walking to their [offices near Kelly's
work](http://www.google.com/local?f=q&hl=en&q=5300+NE+Elam+Young+Pkwy+Hillsboro,+OR+97124)
either to explain the situation, strangle someone, or both.  
  
Anyway, in a record 7 weeks, Yahoo! was able to fix my problem. One good
thing in all this is that Yahoo! sent me a survey after nearly every
response. I sent some very strong messages in both the scores and the
write in comments. I hope they read them.
