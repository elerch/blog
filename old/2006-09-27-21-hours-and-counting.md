That's how long it's been since:  
  

1.  A router reboot
2.  An IP address change on Verizon

I found out the other day that the reason my IP address kept changing
(and subsequently knocking me off the phone), was that I didn't have
Verizon's VDI-624 router as the first router in my setup. The VDI-624 is
the same as a DI-624 router from DLink but has specialized firmware for
Verizon. The interface looks the same, but they must truly have done
something different to it.  
  
Anyway, after fixing the IP address change problem, my old problem of
router reboots came back. I run both eMule and Bittorrent, and so I have
an insane number of connections open. For some odd reason, the router
could handle the connections when my Vonage router was closest to the
Internet (even though it was in the Vonage router's DMZ), but not when
the VDI-624 is closest to the Internet. Odd. I didn't really need
Bittorrent running so I shut it down completely and all is well,
although it would be nice to have everything running, so maybe I'll play
with it another day. Not today. Today, everything is working as
designed. That's a good thing.
