A little bit of randomness. We had an air conditioning tune up
yesterday. Basically, they just checked everything out...no actual
maintenance was required). During the check-out, they asked if I had a
bunch of vents closed. I had been closing the downstairs vents to force
the cold air upstairs in the summer. However, the idea backfired
somewhat, as this just created back pressure that kept the cold air
sitting in the vents rather than coming through the house.  
  
The technician told me never to close more than 1 or 2 vents in the
house at any given time. Another AC tip - to reduce the temperature
difference between upstairs and downstairs (without zoning), set the fan
to "ON" rather than auto. The AC compressor won't kick in unless the
temp gets to high, but leaving the fan on will ensure that the air
continues to get circulated throughout the house.
