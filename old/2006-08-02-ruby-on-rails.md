I got a chance to check out [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) the
other day. That basically explains it. Rails is a set of libraries that
use the programming language Ruby to make web programming very, very
productive. I've heard of defections to RoR from .NET and Java. I'm sure
there are some, but the stories appear to be anecdotal. Anyway, it looks
promising, and I hope the competition helps improve the productivity of
all languages...
