I had some time the other day so I actually looked at the stats for the
[2 smartphone
applications](http://emilsblog.lerch.org/2006/04/smartphone-applications.html)
I wrote a while ago. I was shocked to find that
[Notepad](http://sourceforge.net/projects/notepadsf) had 558 downloads
and [Stopwatch](http://sourceforge.net/projects/stopwatchplussf) had 275
downloads. I don't know how many people are actually installing and
using these applications, but I'm glad I could help make their lives a
bit easier.
