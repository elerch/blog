I was just typing up an email, and noticed that I looked down at the
keyboard to find the delete key. I asked myself why, and then looked at
the keyboards around me. Home, End, Delete, Insert, page up and page
down are all grouped together, but on every keyboard I use, they're in a
different configuration.  
  
My Dell keyboard at work is:  

> <span style="font-family: courier new;">Home PgUp</span>  
> <span style="font-family: courier new;">End PgDn</span>  
> <span style="font-family: courier new;">Delete Insert</span>  

My Thinkpad:  

> <span style="font-family: courier new;">Insert Home PgUp</span>  
> <span style="font-family: courier new;">Delete End PgDwn</span>  

My [new
keyboard](http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/keyboards/keyboard_mice_combos/devices/140&cl=us,en)
at home:  

> <span style="font-family: courier new;">Home End</span>  
> <span style="font-family: courier new;">Insert PgUp</span>  
> <span style="font-family: courier new;">Delete PgDwn</span>  

All three configurations make sense (especially the Thinkpad, which has
an additional complexity of space issues), but it seems that at least on
the desktop, there should be a standard.
