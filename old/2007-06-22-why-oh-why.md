Do I get [this
page](https://www22.verizon.com/FiOSForHome/channels/FiOS/olo_futurenotification.aspx?NPN=FN),
telling me that I can't get FiOS, when not only is it possible for me to
get FiOS, but I'm <span style="font-weight: bold;">connecting to the web
site over a FiOS connection!</span>  
  
You'd think they would have fixed this in the past 18 months, but I
guess they're not interested in new customers.  
  
(I go to the site periodically to find out if I can add TV to my
existing FiOS, but I'm not sure why I bother...I apparently need to call
to find out. When I originally had FiOS installed, the site said I
couldn't get it, but customer service looked in their computers and
found out it was no problem at all)
