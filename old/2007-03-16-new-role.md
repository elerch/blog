So, I'm all set...getting settled into a new role as a capability
manager at Intel, working on non-Direct customer applications and data.
If that's clear to you, let me know because I have some questions
myself. ;-)  
  
It's been quite the start - this is actually a very high priority in our
group right now due to the variety of systems that contain unique sets
of customer data. Everything is coming to a head right now due to a
desire to converge onto a single platform, so my first program and
project will be on the critical path to at least 5 other programs. I've
been in 3 days of meetings in my new role already this week (while
trying to carve time out for transition out of my old role), and I only
knew what I'd be doing Monday afternoon. Yuck. Anyway, enough work
stuff...
