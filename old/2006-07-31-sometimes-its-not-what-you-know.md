[Jeff](http://spirko.blogspot.com) told me he was going to blog about
this, but it doesn't look like he's done it yet, so I will. Jeff has
been looking for a notebook recently, and since I work for Intel I'm
pretty close to that particular market. I'm also working on the
[Verified By
IntelÂ®](http://www.intel.com/cd/channel/reseller/emea/eng/283358.htm)
program, which deals directly with the notebook market, so I'm pretty
clued in.  
  
So Jeff emails me on July 3rd to ask me what the T2050 processor is. He
found a notebook that includes the processor, and can't find any
information on Intel.com...I verify his results, find [processor
information on
wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Core_microprocessors),
and then the fun begins. I can't find information anywhere internally,
which is a huge problem for me because if I can't find information, that
means that Intel can't process returns on the product and there is no
support documentation on the product.  
  
Jeff emails customer support, and after being routed around (support is
looking at the same things I am, so they're running into the same
problem), basically gets back a non-response around July 11. I have a
few internal contacts that Jeff doesn't have access to, so I email them,
but Intel is in the middle of a [major
launch](http://www.intel.com/core2duo/index.htm?iid=HMPAGE+Feature_06ww30)
at this time, so I don't get back any response. Finally I hear back on
July 25th, and the information I get back is somewhat disturbing. I find
that:  

-   The processor is "off roadmap", meaning that it wasn't planned at
    all, but rather put onto the market at the last minute, without any
    supporting documentation.
-   It's OEM-only (I support "boxed products" - these are products that
    you can buy in a box online or through a retailer). Being OEM only,
    you can only get the processor if it's already in a computer. This
    is why it's not in my tool for returns, but it still should be in
    for technical support...
-   The person responsible for worldwide support of the processor didn't
    know anything about the processor until he bumped into one at
    Circuit City.
-   This apparently happens all the time with desktop processors.

What a way for a company to support its products. Hopefully the [drive

will help...
