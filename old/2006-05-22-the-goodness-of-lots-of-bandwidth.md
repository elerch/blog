So FIOS appears to be fairly stable now with the exception of random
router reboots about once/wk. I won't rant on that right now, but I
would like to quickly brag. Last Friday, Kelly and I were working from
home, and for an hour, we:  

-   Both used the phone (her on [Vonage](http://www.vonage.com), me on
    [Skype](http://www.skype.com) using
    [SkypeOut](http://www.skype.com/products/skypeout/), which is free
    until the end of the year to US/Canada phone numbers)
-   She used VPN and Netmeeting
-   I used a form of VPN and ran reports/data extracts during the
    meeting

The service worked fine the whole time (with the exception of a random
router reboot...grr).
