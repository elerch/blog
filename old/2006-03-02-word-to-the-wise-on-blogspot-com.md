Umm...apparently it's bad news to use the &lt; character flippantly on
Blogger. My last post talked about AAPL P/S being &lt4, and when used in
compose mode, it had the effect of mangling my last paragraph. I've
actually been generally underwhelmed by Blogger's inability to properly
format without forcing me to use HTML. Users should not have to
necessarily understand and manipulate the underlying technology.

Don't confuse that statement by thinking it means systems should hide
the underlying technology completely - power users should have access.
My point is that general users shouldn't have paragraphs mangled when
they type in a &lt; sign, and have to:  

-   Know what broke
-   Go to HTML to fix it
-   Know the HTML code for &lt;
