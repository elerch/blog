I can't believe it took this long to find out this little factoid about
myself. I was on the phone today with a customer service agent, and I
announced my name as I always do: "Hi, this is Emil Lerch. I'm calling
because...".  
  
In this case, however, after I described the issue I was having, the
customer service agent said, "I'm sorry, did you say you were with
Merrill Lynch?". Thinking about it, I can totally see how under a bit of
distortion, my name does sound a bit like a giant brokerage firm. Who
knew?
