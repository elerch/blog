Sometimes this stuff drives me nuts...I get an email with a link, but
the URL itself is attached to a graphical button, and Outlook doesn't
let me copy the hyperlink off an image. I click the button, which
launches my default browser (firefox), which the site doesn't support,
so they redirect me to URL/unsupportedbrowser.aspx in a way that doesn't
allow me to hit the back button to see the original URL.  
  
In fact, the application, which literally includes a button that adds
you to a list of people attending a meeting, does NOT actually support
firefox. I have to assume the time they spent coding in a nice "your
browser is unsupported" message far outweighed the time it would have
taken to support a firefox user clicking a single button, but that's
another gripe session. For some reason, this particular app also crashes
firefox when I add the site to the IE Tab Sites filter and let IE run
the app.  
  
My easiest method for dealing with this situation (without changing
default browsers just for this scenario), is to change my firefox user
agent, let the broken application load, and copy/paste the URL into a
real IE.  
  
Not until crazy stuff like this is resolved will average users really
pick up firefox. Well, that and getting the browser pre-installed on
machines. ;-)
