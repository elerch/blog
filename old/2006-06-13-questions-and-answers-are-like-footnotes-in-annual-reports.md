I was watching a webcast the other day (topic irrelevant) and it
occurred to me that what I really like about webcasts and earnings
conference calls is the Q&A section at the end. All the pre-canned stuff
in the beginning can be so filled with political spin it's hard to get a
handle on what's really going on. Q&A (either participating in or
listening to) provides the opportunity to cut through some of that and
get the real information.
