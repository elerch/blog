I ran across a problem the other day in a PHP script, where a variable
wasn't getting populated. It turned out that I misspelled the variable
name - clearly my fault. However, it got me thinking about the language
itself, and how it is actually somewhat hypocriful. On one hand, PHP
(and Javascript for that matter), is relaxed when it comes to variables.
There is no strong typing, and in PHP, you don't even need to declare a
variable before using it. On the other hand, both languages are type
sensitive.  
  
It seems to me that if you're going to have a laid back policy in
regards to variable naming, you should also be laid back when it comes
to case. Being case sensitive with weak controls on variable definition
doesn't make sense. It's the computer science equivelent of mixing first
and third person.
