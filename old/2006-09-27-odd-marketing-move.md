I came home today to find a UPS 2nd day air envelope at my front door.
Not expecting anything, I went ahead and opened it up to find a letter
from Verizon trying to get me to sign up for their FIOS service. Well, I
already have FIOS, it works pretty well now that I think I have the
kinks out of it, and so I'm not sure it was worth the crazy amount it
probably cost to do a direct mail solicitation using UPS 2nd day air.  
  
Of course, I'm blogging about it, so maybe it wasn't a bad move?
