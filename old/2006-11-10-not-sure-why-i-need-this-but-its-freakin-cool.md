So I went to my usual yearly eye exam the other day, and they had a new
piece of equipment to help make sure that my retinas were healthy. It
takes a picture of your retinas. Anyway, after the deal was done, the
technician asked me if I wanted the photos emailed to me. Do I need
that? Absolutely not. Is it cool? Yes. My response? Totally email it!  
  
Without further ado...
