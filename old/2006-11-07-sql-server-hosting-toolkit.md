Just stumbled across this in my travels, and it looks pretty cool. This
[SQL Server Hosting
Toolkit](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=sqlhost&title=Database%20Publishing%20Wizard)
will generate database scripts from one database to deploy to another
database, in an environment where full access is not available, say at
[GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com).
