I've been working on [this
list](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p9VpnOc6eSLLWVL_yUTWrFg)
for some time, and now I think it's finally near comprehensive. This is
the full list of software I install. Software is organized by category,
where:  

-   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Basic </span>software gets
    installed on any machine
-   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Home </span>software gets installed
    at home
-   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Development </span>software gets
    installed on any machine whenever I need it
-   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Business </span>software gets
    installed on my work laptop
-   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Server </span>software is installed
    on my home server (expected to be up 24x7)
-   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Portable </span>software runs
    directly from my USB key
-   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Portable - Development</span>
    software is used for development from [my USB
    key](http://www.ocztechnology.com/products/flash_drives/ocz_ultra_slim_mini_kart_usb_2_0_flash_drive)

Make sure to check out the other sheets in the spreadsheet. They
include:  

-   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Resources </span>to find good tools
-   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Firefox addins</span> (there's no
    good way I know of to simply install a large number of addins, which
    would be nice for initial install)
-   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Configuration Options</span>, which
    describes how I configure the various OS and application options (it
    would be nice to optimize this). I don't have that list built yet,
    but hope to soon.
-   Software I've used in the past and have <span
    style="font-weight: bold;">removed </span>for one reason or another.
    Interesting trip down memory lane for me, but I thought keeping the
    list would be good for others who might want to avoid some of the
    items on that list

I've also setup (but not tested) two
[InstallPad](http://www.installpad.com) files to help streamline install
of several of these applications. These are items from my
[Basic](http://www.lerch.org/applist.xml) category and items from the
[Home and Development](http://www.lerch.org/homeanddevelopment.xml)
categories.  
  
I'll keep the list updated and current, and when I do an initial
install, I'm sure the Installpad files will get tested and the list
updated with stuff I've missed. Here's the URL again for reference:
