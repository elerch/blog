I find that internal sites and "logistics" sites (e.g. travel) tend to
have a crazy number of popups for no reason. Seriously, don't the people
at these companies use the Internet? There is a place an time for a
popup, but these guys go nuts. Here's the popup count for a typical
"view my claim status" on Intel's (outsourced) health benefits site:  

-   Go to the home page. Browser reports that a popup was blocked.
    Whatever this is, it's irrelevant to what I'm doing. I've <span
    style="font-weight: bold;">never</span> viewed this popup.
-   Click login. A popup window appears to collect my user/password. The
    original screen is not used again.
-   Click "manage my account". Another popup. At least in this case, the
    old screen is marginally useful, as I could go back to it to get to
    another transaction (like changing my address vs. managing claims,
    where I am now). Of course, I've never gone in to do more than one
    thing at a time, so leaving this window is useless to me. I'm now at
    3 pages open and haven't even gotten to my claim yet.
-   Click my account (flexible spending account), and claims, without
    popups. Awesome. These are 2 out of 4 mouse clicks on the site that
    did <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> generate popups.
-   Click the claim to see details. Another (blocked) popup, but this
    one actually is important and the only popup that I might make an
    argument to keep, as it is intended for very detailed information,
    has a 2D barcode and is generally printed out, then closed.

For those that are counting, I now have 4 windows open, and generally, I
will <span style="font-weight: bold;">never do anything except print the
last window and close everything</span>. My absolute favorite has to be
the popup on clicking the login button...there are more things wrong
with that than I can even count.
