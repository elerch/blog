I've volunteered some time to get a website up and running for a local
organization. The Bethany Coalition was renamed to the [Bethany
Community Network](http://www.bethanycommunity.net), and was originally
formed to help out with planning to accomodate more people moving into
the area. Portland has an urban growth boundary that helps to confine
population and prevent urban sprawl. In our area, the boundary was
expanded to enable more people, but that means new infrastructure needs
to be in place. You can read more about it on their (my) web site. Feel
free to comment or email me directly with suggestions for improvement.
