I don't know what it is about my body clock, but very consistently, when
I travel to India from the west coast, I get crazy awake at 4AM for
probably the first week. I arrived in India Sunday around midnight
(that's about noon west coast time). Now it's Tuesday morning at 4AM
(Monday afternoon about 4PM west coast time) and I'm wide awake.  
  
My strategy here usually involves allowing myself some awake
time...usually about an hour, and then going back to sleep. It may not
be the best strategy, but usually I find that trying to get back to
sleep immediately is pointless anyway, so my real alternatives are to
either indulge myself with some awake time or toss and turn for an hour
trying to get back to sleep.  
  
I'm only here for a week this time, so my body will probably finish
adjusting just when I'm ready to go home.
