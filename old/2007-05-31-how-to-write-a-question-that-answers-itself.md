Just ask a yes/no question in a FAQ about whether or not a feature
exists. The answer to that question is clearly "Yes". For instance, this
question from Google calendar's FAQ:  
  
[Can I check my calendar information via
SMS?](http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=37228&topic=8567)  
  
Clearly I can check my calendar information via SMS. I don't see another
question saying "Can I check my calendar information via carrier
pigeon?". The reason I don't see this question, is that I can <span
style="font-weight: bold;">not </span>check my calendar information that
way, and Google isn't typically going to put a FAQ item out there to
tell people what they won't do...FAQs are as much of a marketing tool as
a way to disseminate information.  
  
So the answer is yes, the real question is <span
style="font-weight: bold;">how </span>would I do that? Click the link
and find out. Kind of makes you wonder why they don't rephrase the
question as "How do I check my calendar information via SMS?"
