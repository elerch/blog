I haven't actually used Outlook 12, but I just read a short list of Omar
Shahine's [favorite
features](http://blogs.msdn.com/melissamacbeth/archive/2006/02/17/534491.aspx).
I look forward to the new features (there is also a document
auto-preview that looks cool but I really look forward to figuring out
how it's breaking my system).  
  
I find the color categories feature strangely familiar from
gmail...maybe they'll incorporate that feature into Windows Live and
really copy Gmail. ;-)  
  
In MS's defense, at least they're not too proud to copy features (or buy
companies) when they're out-innovated.
