Kelly and I have been on a tear lately (as much of a tear as us
analytical/methodical people can be) getting the house the way we want
it. We've been selling some stuff on craigslist and making a ton of
purchases. Here's a quick list of what I can remember doing over the
last 6 months:  

-   Had house interior painted (this is huge, considering our two-story
    formal living room)
-   Created a "photo wall"
-   Purchased three bookcases, gave one bookcase to goodwill
-   Moved some picture frames to a new wall
-   Got an [entertainment
    center](http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=5614670)
    to replace our old one (known as "Pac Man" after we stuck our new
    [plasma
    TV](http://www.google.com/search?q=pioneer+pdp-4214hd&sourceid=navclient-ff&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS202US202&aq=t)
    into the space designed for a regular CRT)
-   Sold floor standing Infinity speakers, center speaker, and [rear
    speakers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000X45FI/ref=wl_it_dp/102-6944168-0516131?ie=UTF8&coliid=IN7PQCIKTGLA3&colid=HYDCG4ZLAHWO),
    purchasing a full set of [Polk
    speakers](http://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-5-piece-theater-speaker/dp/B000ET2HAS/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-6944168-0516131?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1181863817&sr=8-1)
-   (in process) Selling coffee table and end table, with the intension
    of purchasing "cubes" for the family room

Well, today I got a [hidden IR
system](http://www.smarthome.com/59500.html), which so far is making me
very happy. The problem we ran into after all the entertainment center
business is that the center speaker, which clearly belongs in the
center, would cover the IR sensor on the TV, rendering remotes useless
from one half of the room (the half we use the most). The only way to
alleviate the issue was to move the center speaker all the way to one
edge of the TV or the other, which no longer placed it in the center.
The system has completely alleviated that problem. I've only used it in
tests so far, but it seems great.
