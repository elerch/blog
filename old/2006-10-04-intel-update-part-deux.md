Well, I remain gainfully employed, although I will be doing something
different. What exactly, I'm not yet sure. What I do know is that every
manager from my formerly 3rd level manager down has been affected. One
layoff, 2 redeployments, one transition to non-manager employee, and one
move to another organization.  
  
So far, there are 28 people that I know that have been "redeployed". It
doesn't feel like I know 300 people at Intel to really make that a 10%
cut, but any way you cut it this is a difficult time. It's Wednesday of
employee announcement week, but hopefully most everyone now knows their
fate and we can move on. Next week is re-organize week, so better (or at
least different) news is still to come.
