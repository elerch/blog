So my [router
problems](http://emillerch.blogspot.com/2006/09/21-hours-and-counting.html)
came back mysteriously, and disappeared just as mysteriously several
days later. I'm still not sure what the problem was, but in the meantime
I decided I had spent enough of my time trying to diagnose the problem
and bought a [DLink DIR-655](http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=530).
The router still requires a lot of reboots during configuration, but not
nearly as much as my original one. However, this is rock solid, and
fast. I couldn't believe my eyes while I'm on the phone (using VoIP
through the Internet) and watching a 435MB download ([Visual Studio
SP1](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/support/vs2005sp1/default.aspx))
clicking off about 1MB/sec, which is nearly my rated download speed
through Verizon FIOS.  
  
Oh, and I was also connected to work at the time. Also, I haven't had a
single unscheduled reboot since setting it up.
