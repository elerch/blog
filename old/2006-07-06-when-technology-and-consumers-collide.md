So I ran into a really weird situation with the camcorder I recently
purchased. The camcorder has two data ports, one is
[Firewire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewire), and one is
[USB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB). The camera itself can do three
data-related things:

1.  Transfer recorded video to the computer
2.  Transfer pictures to the computer
3.  Use camcorder as a web cam

In order to do \#1, you need to use the Firewire port. This seems
logical but a bit antiquated. Originally, Firewire could handle speeds
of 400Mbps where USB could only handle 12Mbps. Apparently Sony decided
it was easier to force folks to use the Firewire port than to have to
explain the differences between USB 1.x and USB 2.0, which can handle
speeds of 480Mbps.

All fine so far. I bought the firewire card and cable and installed it
into my computer. Now here's where things get weird. Firewire does
**not** allow you to do \#2 and \#3 above. So now I need to actually use
**both** the firewire and the USB cables in the computer if I want to do
all three operations. How weird. Maybe Sony is trying to transition off
Firewire in favor of USB?

Whatever the reason, it's a very awkward customer experience, and I
personally think they should stick with USB only and suck up having to
explain USB 1.x vs. USB 2.0. I would think they'd enhance the customer
experience while reducing both manufacturing and support costs.
