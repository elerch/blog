So I just finished uploading pictures of my trip to the [Taj
Mahal](http://thelerchs.shutterfly.com/action/pictures?a=67b0de21b3254cae841f)
and [Fatehpur
Sikri](http://thelerchs.shutterfly.com/action/pictures?a=67b0de21b3254ca10520).
Fatehpur Sikri was very impressive, partly because I had no idea what to
expect when I got there (by contrast, most people have an idea of what
the Taj looks like and what it's about).  
  
The [wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatehpur_Sikri) gives
some background on the site, but doesn't mention a very important fact:
I'm told that Akbar had 3 wives, one Christian, one Hindu, and one
Muslim. The entire architecture of the place incorporates themes from
all three religions. An example - the gate called [Buland
Darwaza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buland_Darwaza) is the same height
as the Obelisk in [St. Peter's
Basilica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Peter%27s_Basilica) as an
homage to Christians. The wikipedia entries even confirm this. Some of
the [pictures I
took](http://thelerchs.shutterfly.com/action/pictures?a=67b0de21b3254ca10520)
show the various styles. Here's [another
example](http://thelerchs.shutterfly.com/action/slideshow?a=67b0de21b3254ca10520&auto=0&idx=33&m=1&d=1170676108586)
of what I'm talking about.  
  
I'm also working on getting a translation for [this Arabic
plaque](http://thelerchs.shutterfly.com/action/slideshow?a=67b0de21b3254ca10520&auto=0&idx=75&m=1&d=1170676401386).
It's artistic in nature so it's not easy to read, even for natives (I
have a coworker who is Egyptian).
