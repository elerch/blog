It appears as though my time in my current position (as a product
manager for systems supporting our customer support processes) at Intel
is about to end. The new adventure is still to be determined, but I'm
rapidly closing in on 3 alternatives. I should have more information,
but not necessarily a final answer, sometime next week.
