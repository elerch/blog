I'm currently on hold with my
[pediatrician](http://dch.ohsuhealth.com/index.cfm?pageid=502Â§ionID=117&open=120&cfid=6&cftoken=59572841)
and was amused by the phone announcement. After the usual "if this is an
emergency please hang up and call 911" yada yada, it mentioned that "if
you are a non-english speaker, please call us at xxx-xxx-xxxx". Well, if
I were a non-english speaker, would I really understand that request?
The note was never repeated in Spanish (or any other language).
