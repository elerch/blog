What a crazy few months - more on that later. Just wanted to mention
that I do intend to pick up the blog again (roughly daily as I did last
year). Future topics:  

-   Work-related stuff
-   Javascript/PHP hypocrisy  
-   Consumer electronics (FIOS TV service, Logitech MX 5000 for BT,
    Jabra BT8010, etc.)
-   Work done to the house
-   Other stuff on my mind that no one probably cares about  

Also wanted to quickly mention a big CONGRATULATIONS to Doug and Lisa
Downey on the birth of their daughter Greta Marie!
