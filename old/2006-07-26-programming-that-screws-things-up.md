As I am waiting to respond to a friend of mine today because my browser
won't respond, I'm reminded of a few really stupid things that hopefully
will become less common in software in the future.  
  
The specific incident today was that I wanted to click on a link
(Outback Steakhouse Menu), but the browser stopped responding. Was my
computer slow? No. Was it doing something else to the point where it
couldn't handle my command? No. What happened was that I had been
downloading a 50MB file from a web site. The other browser window just
finished downloading the file...so the last step in the process is to
copy the file from the temporary directory to the final download
directory. During that step, apparently all other browser windows stop
operating.  
  
These issues make computing frustrating, and to the casual user, makes
the computer "slow".  
  
Other annoyances:  

-   Modal dialog boxes. These are barely tolerable under normal
    circumstances, but are horrible in applications with multiple
    windows when the modal dialog box requires input before any
    operation can commence in any window. Adobe Acrobat does a fantastic
    job with this one...they have a window come up for their product
    updates that sometimes pops under the browser when you view a PDF
    through the browser. It can hang Firefox and can appear to hang
    Internet Explorer.
-   Waiting to have it "perfect" before displaying results. Windows
    explorer is a good example - some directories will take 30 seconds
    or more because I have large files and it wants to do something (to
    prepare thumbnails maybe?). I don't even need the icons right away -
    just show me the file names and fill the rest in on your own time!
-   Lack of user feedback. This just happened to me also. Click on a
    link (Quicktime movie) and nothing appears to happen. It's actually
    downloading but I don't have any feedback, so I click it again, and
    the download restarts, but I am completely unaware of this. I see
    others struggle with this one. My favorite is when someone launches
    a really big application but there's no feedback, so they launch it
    again, and repeat until eventually the computer brings up the
    application, but then brings up like 10 more windows and is
    completely choking on memory.

Other examples aren't coming to me, but I'll try to post when I run
across one. Feel free to leave comments with other good annoyances that
appear to slow/stall the computer, but really aren't.
