A couple days ago I got a flyer on my door advertising a security system
and monitoring package. I'm not sure how many people actually respond to
a blanket flyer like that, but it got me thinking...wouldn't the flyer
have been more effective had they managed to leave it somewhere <span
style="font-weight: bold;">inside</span> the house while we weren't
home? Illegal - yes. Effective: definitely.
