I feel much the same way about Sony's products as I do about
[Apple](http://emillerch.blogspot.com/2006/03/much-ado-about-apple.html).
I will never, for instance, buy any product that takes a memory stick.  
  
However, there's a big difference in my mind between the two companies.
First, Sony appears to be (slowly) realizing the error of it's
proprietary ways. Second, as an investor, Sony is a huge conglomerate
with revenue sources from many areas. While the second fact actually
slows down adoption of open standards, it does smooth out the revenue
stream.  
  
There's quite a bit I could also discuss about
[Blu-Ray](http://www.%5Cblu-ray.com) here, and while blu-ray has its
drawbacks, it is (at least in theory) an open standard.
