There's been much ado about gas prices lately. I've seen a lot of
irresponsible (or just plain ignorant) reporting on the matter.
Headlines like ["Chevron Earnings Soar 49 Percent to
$4B"](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060428/ap_on_bi_ge/earns_chevron) and
["Exxon Mobil 1Q Profit Up 7 Pct. to
$8.4B"](http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/060427/earns_exxon_mobil.html?.v=9)
provides very little context, and if you actually read the report,
you'll notice a lot of dollar figures. I have not seen (or heard on the
news) a single non-financial report of gas industry profit that even
mentions margin. I might be picking on AP a little here, because both my
examples were AP, but they are one of the most read news sources, so
they have a greater responsibility to get things right. Anyway, the
whole thing reminds me of deficit headlines that don't compare deficit
as a percentage of GDP.  
  
This post is about bad reporting, but I'll mention that my opinion on
the gas thing is that gas is a commodity and that as such, the oil
companies are price takers, not price makers, and so they have very
little control over these things. An [11%
(Chevron)](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=CVX)/[16%
(ExxonMobil)](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=XOM) operating margin is
pretty-freaking far from "windfall profits", and appears in line with
other commodity industries like
[steel](http://biz.yahoo.com/p/130conameu.html).
