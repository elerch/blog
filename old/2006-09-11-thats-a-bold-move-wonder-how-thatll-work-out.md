So I've just finished making the switch for my default browser on my
work system. I wanted something other than Internet Explorer primarily
for tabbed browsing purposes, but secondarily to help reduce the amount
of memory that IE takes up.  
  
My first switch was to [Maxthon](http://www.maxthon.com/), which
internally runs IE but handles tabbed browsing and [mouse
gestures](http://www.maxthon.com/features.htm). I now pretty much expect
my browser to handle mouse gestures and get frustrated if holding the
right mouse button and moving down and then right doesn't close the
tab.  
  
Maxthon was really very good, except that there was no plugin available
to handle [Google Bookmarks](http://www.google.com/bookmarks/), which
solved another [thorny issue for
me](http://emillerch.blogspot.com/2006/06/bookmark-nirvana.html).  
  
Firefox sounded like a great solution except for the number of sites I
use (primarily inside Intel) that require ActiveX controls and other IE
specifics. I bumped across the solution to this recently when running
into an extension called [IE
Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1419/). This allows you to load
IE within Firefox, mostly taking care of those issues. It hasn't worked
with Test Director (and neither does their plugin from 1999), so I'm not
entirely off IE, but I'm nearly there.  
  
Oh, and NTLM authentication for the tons of Intel sites that need it?
Yeah, it's [got
that](http://blogs.wdevs.com/shog9/archive/2005/03/09/2668.aspx)...
