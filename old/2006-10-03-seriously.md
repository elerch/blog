I just went to find the phone number for a local Indian resteraunt
called the [Curry Leaf](http://www.curryleafpdx.com). I found the phone
number on their web page, but also noticed that [they have a
blog](http://curryleafpdx.blogspot.com/). Not sure what a resteraunt
needs with one...I can see a chef, maybe, but just the resteraunt?  
  
Also enjoyed their [contact us
page](http://www.curryleafpdx.com/curryleaf/curry_new/contactus.html),
which tells us what their website URL is. Of course if I'm on their web
site, wouldn't I already know that?  
  
Hmm...anyway, they have good Indian food. ;-)
