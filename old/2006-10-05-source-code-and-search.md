It was only yesterday I ran across a [search engine for source
code](http://www.codase.com/). Today, I find that [Google is entering
the same
market](http://news.com.com/Google+crawls+into+source+code+search/2100-1024_3-6122819.html?tag=nl).
Cool.  
  
Oh, and here's the link to the actual [Google search
