I just signed up for a service to connect me to Intel's network while
out of town. I got 3 emails to confirm my service was active:  
  

1.  Email with my username
2.  Email with my password
3.  Email to state that my order was approved

Good idea...seperate the username email from the password email
(although a better idea would be to allow me to choose username and
password). However, email \#3 included both my username and my password,
so a) what's the point of the other 2 emails, and b) the security
advantage has been completely defeated.  
  
Think people...think.
