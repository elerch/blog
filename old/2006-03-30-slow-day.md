This is one of those very rare events for me - a slow day. This day has
been brought to me by a a series of events that have all coincided at
once:  

-   India has a holiday, so development and QA teams are not working
-   Most of my projects are in QA right now
-   A major event is going to occur next Monday at work, and in order
    for me to finish preparing I need to get information from some
    coworkers
-   All systems are running fairly well
-   Projects have been completing, but fewer new projects have been
    created over the last 3-4 weeks, so overall workload has been light
    the last 2 weeks, allowing me time to catch up

Weird - I don't know what to do with myself. I'm definitely not
complaining...
